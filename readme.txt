== Description ==

AppBrowzer plugin converts websites built on wordpress into a mobile app (we call it App 2.0) within minutes. This mobile App 2.0 will be assigned with an App URL and can be browsed from an App called AppBrowzer. 

This plugin will use the existing website infrastructure to create App 2.0 saving a lot of time, resources and money needed to create a new App from scratch. The plugin will simply read the existing content/information from the website and display it in a mobile app structure.
